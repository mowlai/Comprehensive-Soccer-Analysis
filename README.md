The purpose of the project is to perform an analysis on the largest open collection of soccer-logs ever released, collected by [Wyscout] (https://wyscout.com/) containing all the spatio-temporal events (passes, shots, fouls, etc.)

The repository consists in the following file:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all research questions.
  	
		Exploratory Data Analysis
			1. [RQ1] Who wants to be a Champion?
			
			2. [RQ2] Is there a home-field advantage?  

			3. [RQ3]: Which teams have the youngest coaches? 

			4. [RQ4]: Find the top 10 players with the highest ratio between completed passes and attempted passes.  

			5. [RQ5]:Does being a tall player mean winning more air duels? 
			
			6. [RQ6]: Free your mind!
			
		Core Research Questions 
			1. [CRQ1]: What are the time slots of the match with more goals?
			
			2. [CRQ2]:  Visualize movements and passes on the pitch!

2. __`functions.py`__:
	> A python script which provides all the functions used in the `main.ipynb` notebook.
3. __`theory.pynb`__:
	>  A Jupyter notebook that contains the answer to the theoretical exercise.
